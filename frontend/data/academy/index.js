                    After navigating the industry from manufacturing, to
                    distribution, and eCommerce, we realized that most
                    training programs are unclear or donâ€™t even show the
                    logistics of getting things properly made and launched
                    in the market. After going through this course you
                    will have clarity about all facets of the apparel
                    industry, and will be better prepared to grow your
                    brand.
